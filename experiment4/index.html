				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>Generates an endless ocean (or lava!) with a variety of islands scattered around the world. As you look around using the Arrow Keys and time passes on, 
					waves will push through the seas, starting and stopping at random points. Click on any part of the island to dig, and potentially find coins for treasure!

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>It took a long time brainstorming with Jason (who I worked with) to figure out how this project would work, but once it did it was fun to work on an isometric grid. Making the ocean feel alive
					with featurecreep and multiple cups of coffee was fun. Digging could've been touched on a bit more by me, but otherwise I'm happy with how this turned out; the world feels very organic
					while still being boundless.
