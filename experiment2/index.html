				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>The sky is bright and full of stars. Look around and see them swirl; shake your cursor and see them speed up! Just like that one Moon Knight scene.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>The stars are drawn every single frame by judging where it should be based on a trail shaped like an ellipsis it's forced to follow. Stars leave behind
					afterimages which are not removed. The night sky is partially transparent, and with every frame done, another layer of the night sky is drawn, layering over
					the stars' afterimages like walls of stained glass, making it appear like the stars are leaving behind a trail.

					The trees have random generation where they spawn, dictating which trees spawn in the front, middle, or back layer. They are seeded and then redrawn every
					single frame. The moon that moves around in the sky is additionally chosen randomly at the start of the sky and continuously moves around.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Working on this was pretty similar to other projects I've worked on in the past. The idea was Jason's, and it was an idea I liked a lot and had fun working with.
					Felt like a good project to get the rust off.
